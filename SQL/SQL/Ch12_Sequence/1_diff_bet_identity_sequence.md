# **Difference between IDENTITY() and SEQUENCE:**

- IDENTITY() can be used for one table  
 But
- SEQUENCE can be used for multiple tables as it is an object and can be called multiple times.

---

- IDENTITY() is a property  
But  
- SEQUENCE is an object.

---

- IDENTITY() does not have min and maxvalue  
But  
- We can specify min and max value in SEQUENCE.
