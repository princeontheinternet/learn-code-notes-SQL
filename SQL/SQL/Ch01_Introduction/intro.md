> ## **Knowledge:**

- Combination of information, experience, insight etc
- I scored 98 marks with my hard work and intelligence.

> ## **Database:**

- It is a systematic collection of data (tables).
- Databases are systems that allow users to store and organize data.
- Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.
- Eg - College database stores info about students, teachers, classes, subjects etc.
- Database design is a critical step which consists of 3 stages: **Conceptual Model** , **Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD)** and **Database Schema**.

> ## **DBMS:**

- Database Management System is a system that allows users to access the database using SQL language.
- Eg - MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, etc. are RDBMS that use SQL.

---

- **RDBMS** is a Relational Database Management System that stores data in tabular form and includes rows/records/tuples and columns/attributes/fields whereas DBMS stores data in files.
- An RDBMS is a tabular DBMS that maintains the security, integrity, accuracy, and consistency of the data.

  - **Data Integrity** - Overall completeness, accuracy, and consistency of data over it's entire lifecycle. (Data must not change during transmission)
  - Data Integrity concerns the correctness and completeness of data in the database.
  - Eg - Student taking admission to a branch that is not available in college.

- With the help of SQL, you can interact or communicate with the Database.
