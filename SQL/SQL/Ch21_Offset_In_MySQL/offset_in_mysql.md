- In MySQL, the OFFSET keyword is used in combination with the LIMIT keyword to retrieve a subset of rows from a table. 

- The OFFSET clause specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the query result set.

- In the above EG, it will give a single row and will skip all rows until the sixth row which will become the sixth highest record. 

- Offset starts with 0 i.e. the highest record.
